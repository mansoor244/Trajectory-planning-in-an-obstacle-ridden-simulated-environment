 In this project, the simulation of the UR10
 robot is shown in an obstacle-ridden environment.
 The main goal of this project is to simulate the
 robot under real-world constraints. This is done by
 the control of the robotâ€™s dynamics. To move the
 end effector from the start position to the goal po
sition the path planning algorithm RRT (Rapidly
 exploring Random Tree) is used. This algorithm
 provides the shortest path that avoids obstacles.
 All the work is done in a MATLAB environment.
 MATLAB provides almost every aspect of robot
 operation that is required in this project.
